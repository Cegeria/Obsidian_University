## Transitive and reflexive closing
Let $R', \ R$ be relations and $C$ be a property
**Def:** $R'$ is a *closing* of $R$ relative to $C$ if:
1. $R'$ has property $C$
2. $R \subset R'$
3. $R'$ is the smallest

**Definitions:** 
$\displaystyle R^+ := \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} R^k$ is a *transitive closing*; 
$\displaystyle R^* := \bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} R^+$ is a reflexive closing
