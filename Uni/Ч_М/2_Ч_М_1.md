# Function Approximation
Given $n+1$ points: $\{x_i, y_i\}_{i = 0}^{n}$
We construct a polynomial $P$ such that $P(x_i) = y_i \forall i = 0, \ldots, n$
## Lagrange polynomial

## Newton polynomial
### Forward

### Backward

## Hermitian polynomial
Besides $\{x_i, y_i\}_{i = 0}^{n}$ also given derivatives $dy_i$

# Visualisation
1. Function and polynomial with marked points (2 polynomials with different number of knots)
2. Error
3. Max error depending on number of knots (2 to around 60 for standard net and to around 100 for Chebyshev net)

$\underset{i}{\max}|f(x_{i + 1/2}) - P(x_{i + 1/2})|$
# Variant
$f(x) = \sqrt{x} + \cos(x)$
Hermitian polynomial with formula, standard net
